# A Simple NodeJS Rest example

To run this demo:
1. Fork this repo and modify the following button changing the URL on this README.md file:
2. Start the workspace: [![Contribute](factory-contribute.svg)](https://codeready-workspaces.apps.cluster-2ff8.2ff8.example.opentlc.com/factory?url=https://github.com/marrober/simpleRest)

The URL should use your instance of Che/CodeReady Workspaces:

```
https://codeready-workspaces.apps.cluster-2ff8.2ff8.example.opentlc.com/factory?url=https://github.com/marrober/simpleRest
```

Alternatively,
1. Add your prefered Che or CodeReady Workspaces instance: https://blog.sunix.org/factory (that would just do the right redirection to the right server based on your preferences)
2. Start the workspace: [![Contribute](factory-contribute.svg)](https://codeready-workspaces.apps.cluster-2ff8.2ff8.example.opentlc.com/factory?url=https://github.com/marrober/simpleRest)
